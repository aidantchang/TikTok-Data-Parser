# IMPLEMENTATION
Project is fairly simple, does not have multiple classes or objects, implements seperate functions to handle scanning of entire data file and time of each video log. Data is passed in through "Video Browsing History.txt" in the same directory and when Java file is run, prompts user for different options to search history.
